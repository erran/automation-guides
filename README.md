# Automation guides
This set of guides will help set some ground rules to follow when
designing automated test frameworks. It is written in the style of
[thoughtbot's guides][thoughtbot-guides]. Read them if you haven't already!

**These are guidelines not a definitive rulebook.** If you disagree with
something [create an issue](https://github.com/erran/automation-guides/issues)
and we can discuss it.

[Start reading the guides here](framework.md).

> High level guidelines:
>
> * Be consistent.
> * Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
> * Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
> * A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.
>
> A note on the language:
>
> * "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
> * "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
> * "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
> * "Use" is a positive instruction.
